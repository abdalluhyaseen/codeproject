<p>The equation for calulating the area of a square <b> A=2<sup>2</sup></b>, where A is the area and s is side length.
     <br> The Pythagorean theorem is: <b>a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup>=c<sup>2</sup></b> , where a and b are the legs og a right
      triangle, 
     and c is the hypotenuse. <br> the formula for compound interest <b>A=P(1+r/n)<sup>nt</sup></b>, Where A is the amount of money
      accumlated after n years, including interest. </p>
